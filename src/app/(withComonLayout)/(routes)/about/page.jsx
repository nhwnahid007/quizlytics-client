              <strong>⏳ Timed Quizzes:</strong>
              <p className="mt-2">
                Every quiz on Quizlytics comes with a configurable time limit,
                ensuring you get a real exam-like experience. A countdown timer
                is prominently displayed to keep you aware of the remaining
                time. As the time nears the end (under 30 seconds), the timer
                turns red to create a sense of urgency. Once the time runs out,
                the quiz is automatically submitted, and you are redirected to
                the results page.

                To ensure fairness and maintain the challenge, each quiz has a
                limit on the number of attempts. This feature encourages users
                to thoroughly prepare before attempting quizzes and adds an
                element of strategy to the learning process. Once you&apos;ve
                reached the maximum allowed attempts, the quiz becomes
                inaccessible, helping ensure a balanced competition.
